# Gamma-Branch_Office_Potential_Analysis

**Project Repository**

This repository holds the code and analysis for a project completed by Muhamad Shidqi, a Business Administration graduate with experience in accountant and tax agribusiness industry and coffee shop management, who recently finished a data science bootcamp.

**Project Brief**

Gamma, a SaaS company, is looking to leverage data to identify potential locations for new branch offices. This project aims to analyze Gamma's existing sales data to uncover insights that can inform branch office decisions.

**Data Description**

The data used in this project will be simulated SaaS sales data, potentially including attributes such as:
* Customer location (city, state/province, country)
* Subscription plan details (type, price)
* Customer acquisition channel (marketing campaign, referral, etc.)

**The project will focus on the following key questions:**

Geographic Trends:
* Which regions or cities have the highest concentration of existing customers?
Are there any emerging markets with significant growth potential?

Customer Segmentation:
* Can customer segments be identified based on factors like subscription plan or acquisition channel?
**This project is expected to deliver the following:**
* Interactive visualizations: Create insightful dashboards or charts to explore the geographic distribution of customers, customer segmentation, and potential correlations between customer characteristics and sales performance.
* Data-driven recommendations: Based on the analysis, identify regions or cities with high potential for new branch offices, considering factors like customer concentration, market growth, and customer segmentation.

**Disclaimer**
This is a simulated project using sample data. The results and recommendations may not be directly applicable to real-world business decisions by Gamma.

**Future Considerations**
Integrate additional data sources (e.g., market research, competitor analysis) to further refine branch office selection criteria.
Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to evaluate the financial feasibility of opening new branch offices in identified locations.
This repository documents the entire data analysis process, including data cleaning, exploration, visualization, and model building (if applicable). The code used for the analysis will be included in the repository, allowing for transparency and reproducibility.
